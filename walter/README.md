# The benchmark

## Challenge 1: Dataset

All datasets were simulated from the model, and were not edited. 
After I tried many different models, all ESSs looked similar, 
and some looked better than the reference example.

So, JC + Constant coalescent + Strict clock = the "king model" of Bayesian phylogenetics. 

## Challenge 2: Model
